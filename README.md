# Zonal-Statistics-MODIS-India
District-level zonal statistics were computed for Tree Cover (MOD44B), Leaf Area Index (MCD15A3H), and Land Surface Temperature (MOD11A1) for two time periods: 2001–2003 and 2023–2025. The objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in vegetation structure and thermal patterns across Indian districts.
